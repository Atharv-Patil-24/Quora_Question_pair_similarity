The Quora Question Pair Similarity problem is a common natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining whether two given questions from Quora are semantically similar. This problem is widely used for research in duplicate detection, paraphrase identification, and text similarity analysis.

**Problem Description**
Quora's platform contains many user-submitted questions, and often, different users ask the same question in slightly different ways. The goal of the problem is to build a model that can automatically detect duplicate questions to improve the user experience and avoid redundancy.

**Objective**
Given two questions, determine whether they are duplicates or different by predicting a binary label:

1 → The questions are semantically identical (duplicates).
0 → The questions have different meanings.

**Dataset**
Quora provides a dataset containing question pairs along with labels indicating whether they are duplicates. The dataset typically includes:
1. id: Unique ID for the question pair.
2. qid1: Unique ID for the first question.
3. qid2: Unique ID for the second question.
4. question1: First question text.
5. question2: Second question text.
6. is_duplicate: Binary label (1 if duplicate, 0 otherwise).

**Challenges**
Paraphrasing: The same meaning can be expressed in many different ways.
Example:
Q1: "How do I learn Python?"
Q2: "What are the best ways to master Python programming?"
Ambiguity: Some questions have multiple meanings depending on context.
Typos & Grammar Variations: Users may make mistakes or phrase questions informally.
Synonyms & Rewording: Different words or sentence structures can mean the same thing.
Scale: Large datasets require efficient NLP techniques.

**Approaches for Solving**

**Feature Engineering (Traditional ML)**
1. TF-IDF or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe)
2. Cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity
3. Length-based features (word count difference)
4. Fuzzywuzzy featurization (fuzzy ratio, etc.)

**Machine learning Algorithms**
1. Random model
2. Logistic regression with L2 regularization
3. Linear SVM with L2 regularization
4. XGBOOST

**Evaluation Metrics**
1. Confusion , precesion, recall matrices.
2. Log Loss: Measures the confidence of predictions.
